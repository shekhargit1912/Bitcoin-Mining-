### SHA
Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA) -256 is the hash function and mining algorithm of the Bitcoin protocol, referring to the cryptographic hash function that outputs a 256 bits long value.

# Bitcoin-Mining-
### To earn actual bitcoin in your wallet you need to integrate Extra mining code with rest of the bitcoin ecosystem. Also you need to have specialized hardware and datacenter with GPUs and ASIC devices that can compute the hash very fast. Also pending transactions get buffered in a transaction mem pool and miners would get these transactions->mine the valid blocks to add them to a blockchain.
